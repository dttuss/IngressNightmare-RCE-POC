‚ö†Ô∏è Critical RCE in Ingress-NGINX via Configuration Injection (CVE-2025-1974 and more)

This repository contains a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for CVE-2025-1974, a Critical (CVSS 9.8) vulnerability in the Ingress-NGINX controller for Kubernetes. This flaw allows unauthenticated remote code execution via unsafe configuration injection when using the Validating Admission Controller. It is the most serious of a set of five vulnerabilities disclosed and patched on March 26, 2025.

‚∏ª

üìå Impact:
‚Ä¢	Affected Versions: Ingress-NGINX controller prior to v1.12.1 / v1.11.5
‚Ä¢	Attack Surface:
	‚Ä¢	Exploitable by any workload on the Pod network ‚Äî no credentials or admin privileges required
	‚Ä¢	Attackers can inject arbitrary NGINX directives (e.g., content_by_lua_block) via annotations like configuration-snippet
	‚Ä¢	When combined with misconfigurations, attackers can exfiltrate Secrets or achieve full cluster compromise
‚Ä¢	Scope:
	‚Ä¢	Ingress-NGINX often has access to all cluster Secrets by default
	‚Ä¢	Pods in a typical cloud VPC or corporate network can reach the admission controller endpoint
	‚Ä¢	Affected clusters include those running Ingress-NGINX with admission control enabled (default in many setups)

‚∏ª

üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation:
‚Ä¢	Upgrade to Ingress-NGINX v1.12.1 or v1.11.5
‚Ä¢	Disable risky annotations (configuration-snippet, server-snippet, etc.)
‚Ä¢	Lock down network access to the Validating Admission Webhook
‚Ä¢	Apply strict RBAC to prevent unauthorized Ingress creation

‚∏ª

üß™ This PoC demonstrates how attackers can leverage the vulnerability to run arbitrary code inside the ingress controller pod ‚Äî which often has access to internal services and secrets ‚Äî escalating to full cluster takeover in vulnerable configurations.
